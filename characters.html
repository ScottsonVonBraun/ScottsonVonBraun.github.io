                <h4>Aphelios Ross</h4>
                A loxodon fighter who will always battle in the name of the law. Aphelios has a strong sense of justice and will not let anyone or anything get in the 
                way of what he believes is right. Being a very large man and coming from the distant Loxoland, means he is often an outsider wherever he goes. 
                However, even in the face of discrimination, he wishes to do good and become a man of honor. He has a legion of fans called the Aphelios Ross Fanclub. He's
                currently sponsored by a shoe company called Rad Kicks. Aphelios wears size 15 shoes.

                was his hotheadedness and his twisted beliefs of right and wrong. After killing a witness involved in a case and shooting his boss, JB, he ended up being sentenced to death, and 
                he had his head sliced in two by Oxford the Ox. However, Julian was revealed to actually still be alive and working as the Knight Hunter, a serial killer who kills knights at night.

                of his Task Force, and wants to see them succeed. JB is currently hospitalized after he had a heart attack due to the stress of the Task Force being arrested by Donovan Pink
