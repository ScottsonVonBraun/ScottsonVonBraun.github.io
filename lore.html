            <h1>Knight Force</h1>

            <h2>Starless Knight</h2>
            Basically fodder. This is the bottom of the Knight totem pole. Once a Knight finishes the Knight Academy, he starts off as this rank. 
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Bronze Star Knight</h2>
            Low ranked Knight. A knight must complete the Bronze Assessment to achieve this rank.
            <p></p>

            The Bronze Assessment is divided into 3 parts:
            <li>Knowledge Test - A test of basic knowledge of the Knight Force and Newtopia.</li>
            <li>Fitness Test - A test of your physical capabilities.</li>
            <li>Combat Test - A test of your combat skills as a team.</li>
            <p></p>

            Bronze Star Knights have little influence over the Knight Force, but they are still highly respected by civilians. Knights of this rank 
            can take on more difficult missions where the stakes are raised and death is a possibility. 
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Silver Star Knight</h2>
            Middle ranked Knight. After completing the Silver Trial, Knights are given this rank. 
            <p></p>

            Before one takes the Silver Trial, there are a few prerequisites:
            <li>100 Community Service Hours</li>
            <li>Proctor a Bronze Assessment</li>
            <li>Complete 5 Bronze Star or Higher Missions</li>
            <p></p>

            Silver Star Knights have quite a bit of power in the Knight Force. They can vote in proceedings to sway the direction of the Knight Force. 
            The King wonâ€™t entertain the presence of anyone lower than this rank. This is where most Knights end their career. At this rank, Knights are 
            typically important in their communities.
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Gold Star Knight</h2>
            High ranked Knight. This rank can only be achieved by being appointed by a Knight of Justice.
            Gold Star Knights have considerable influence over the Knight Force and the whole city. Those who achieve this rank typically have ties to more 
            other businesses outside of the Knight Force, like film, politics, or technology. It is very rare for a Knight to achieve this rank.
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Platinum Star Knight</h2>
            The top of the Knight ranking. This rank can only be obtained by being appointed by the King. Those who achieve this rank join a special group 
            known as the Knights of Justice, a team of the most powerful Knights who control the entire city from behind the scenes. It is extremely rare 
            for one to even meet a Knight of Justice, let alone become a member. Anyone who achieves this rank is guaranteed to be wealthy and powerful for 
            the rest of their life, and will go down in history as one of the Greatest Knights of All Time.
