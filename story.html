            <h1>Starless Saga</h1>
            <h2>Le Elegante Overdose</h2>

            The King’s Secret Knight Task Force began its first mission! Le Elegante Academy, Letalia’s alma mater,  
            was once one of the most prestigious schools in all of Newtopia City. However, tragedy struck the 
            esteemed academy when one of its students, Adan Ford, mysteriously perished. The student’s death was determined 
            to be an overdose, and after interrogating students and teachers at the school, it was discovered 
            that the man who supplied the drugs was a small-time dealer, named Mida Bendo. The Task Force then took 
            some time to rest. Julian and Letalia hung out at a burger shop and while they were getting acquainted, 
            Aphelios befriended Chaddeus, a cool bodybuilder at the gym. The Task Force confronted Mida while 
            he was on his shift working at the movie theater, and while Mida was originally aggressive, he eventually 
            gave himself up to protect his family. In exchange for his family's protection, Mida handed over intel on 
            the whereabouts of his team’s drug warehouse, leading to the capture of Lucy, one of Mida's team members. 
            Lucy’s interrogation went wrong, leading to Julian, killing her. Julian then went nuts and shot JB!
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Trial of Julian Hotapepperin</h2>

            Julian was captured and sentenced to trial for his assault on JB, the murder of Lucy, and other crimes 
            of police brutality. The ones preceding over the trial were three members of the Knights of Justice, the 12 
            strongest Knights on the force. Stuart the Rat was the prosecutor, Medusa the Snake was the bailiff, and 
            Oxford the Ox was the judge. Despite overwhelming evidence, Julian fought for his case until the bitter end, 
            losing all respect from those in the courtroom. After a botched attempt to escape, Oxford sliced Julian 
            in half with his Greataxe, killing him instantly. 
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Disappearance of Wendy Blue</h2>

            A dwarf named Arnold joined the Task Force as Julian's replacement. After Arnold joined the Task Force, 
            the team began their second mission. Don Blue, one of the five Dons who control most of Newtopia City, 
            reported the disappearance of his daughter, Wendy, who worked at the local corner store. Wendy's trail led 
            to a rundown apartment owned by her ex-boyfriend, Mikey. After interrogating Mikey, the team learned 
            that Mikey and Wendy had a falling out, and Wendy ran off to the Casino to make some quick cash in order to leave 
            the city. A series of unfortunate events led to Mikey’s subsequent arrest. The Casino was being ran by Don Red, who 
            allowed the team back to the VIP section where Wendy was being held, after Arnold survived a game of Russian Roulette
            with the Don. Wendy was being used as a sacrifice by Countess Baroba, for her ritual to the God of Youth, Frigalhei. 
            The Task Force was able to save Wendy and subdue Baroba, but right as they were about to leave, Baroba was taken 
            back by Don Red. The Task Force was disgusted by the blatant corruption running rampant in the city, but before they could
            make changes to the way that Newtopia was ran, the Task Force members would have to improve their Star Rankings.
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Bronze Assessment</h2>

            In order to obtain power and respect in the Knight Force, one must improve his Star Ranking. At that moment, the 
            Task Force members were all Starless, but by completing the Bronze Assessment, they could rank up to obtain their Bronze 
            Stars. After taking a day off on a trip to the movies, the following day, the team took the Bronze Assessment. 
            The team went through three trials: a Knowledge Test, a Fitness Test, and a Combat Test. Along the way the team 
            met a strange group of fellow examinees known as the Ab Family, who annoyed and disrupted them at every turn during the exam. However, 
            by defeating the Ab Family in the Combat Test, the Task Force managed to pass the Bronze Assessment, 
            becoming Bronze Star Knights!
            <p></p><hr>

            <h1>Bronze Star Saga</h1>

            <h2>Wet Willy Killer</h2>

            For their first mission as Bronze Star Knights, the Task Force investigated the mysterious Wet Willy Killer, a 
            serial killer known by his calling card: giving all of his victims wet willies. Letalia found out from one of the 
            victim's teachers that all of the victims were in the same class along with a strange loxa kid. The team staked out 
            the house of Nadine Waters, the last remaining girl in the friend group of all of the victims. After some strange 
            encounters with some of the neighbors, Nadine returned after going on a date with the loxa guy, named Cheeto. Cheeto 
            was then revealed to be the Wet Willy Killer! Aphelios tried to reason with Cheeto, as they were both loxo people, but unfortunately, 
            Cheeto was too far gone. While the team managed to subdue Cheeto, it wasn't before Cheeto managed to slit Nadine's throat. 
            Sadly, Nadine succumbed to her injuries, and died. The Task Force was left feeling defeated, but JB reminded them that they 
            must shine on, even in the darkest of nights!
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Don Blue’s Party</h2>

            The Task Force was visited by Stuart the Rat and Medusa the Snake, two of the Knights of Justice from Julian’s trial. 
            Medusa distracted Arnold by taking him out for dinner, and Stuart forced everyone else to stick to the story that Julian 
            was actually a hero, to protect the reputation of the Knight Force. Letalia hung out with her friend, Wendy and watched
            a movie together. Arnold and Aphelios went to the gym to meet Chaddeus, but Chaddeus' friend, Gobo, challenged Arnold to
            a push-up competition. Gobo lost pretty badly. Later, the Task Force was given a strange request by Don Blue 
            to act as bouncers for a party he was throwing for his daughter, Wendy. The Task Force did well as bouncers (aside from
            an incident with a Fake Wendy), but at the end of their night, they were approached by Countess Baroba and Don Red! 
            While Arnold tried to stand his ground, he sensed the insane power of Don Red and was scared into running away. 
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Mother’s Day Maniac</h2>

            While on patrol, the Task Force encountered a member of the Society of Evil, an infamous group of villains. 
            After infiltrating the Society of Evil, the Task Force had a meeting that was interrupted by Kenny the Knight, who informed them that a 
            distress call had come in from a cabin in the woods, known as The Cabin. The team visited The Cabin and found the body of a girl, who’d 
            been beaten to death. Arnold and Letalia tried to find the source of a scream they heard and came face to face with a Very Large Man 
            who had one of the vacationing college students, Billy, cornered. Arnold and Letalia were no match for the Large Man’s power, 
            so they were all forced to flee on Letalia’s back, after she transformed into a horse. Meanwhile, Aphelios stayed back at The Cabin 
            to keep watch over the other students: Logan, Martin, and Violet. Martin tried to convince the team to cut their losses and escape, 
            as he believed the Very Large Man to be the Mother’s Day Maniac, a deranged killer who had murdered a bunch of teenagers a few years ago. However, 
            Martin ended up in an argument with Logan, as Logan didn't want to leave his friends behind, leading to a fight where Martin ended up 
            falling down the stairs and breaking his neck, killing him. The Mother’s Day Maniac made it back to The Cabin, and so did a crying Violet, 
            who was carrying the dead body of her dear friend, Shauna, Billy’s girlfriend. With everyone's combined effort, the Task Force and 
            the college students were able to defeat the Mother’s Day Maniac, who was revealed to be Violet’s brother, Barry Bones! 
            Violet and Barry were working together in this killer operation, so both were arrested. Logan was also arrested for the accidental 
            murder of Martin. Billy decided to become a Knight, under Arnold’s tutelage.   
            <p></p><hr>  

            <h2>Frank Bevuchet Show</h2>
            The Task Force were told by Stuart and Medusa that they were invited on to the most famous talk show in Newtopia City, The Frank Bevuchet Show,
            for catching the famous Mother's Day Maniac. On Frank's show, the Task Force gained a ton of popularity for their great responses. The Task Force
            was visited by the leader of the Knight Force, Don Pink. Don Pink became a huge fan of the Task Force after their talk show appearance. 
            Don Pink arm wrestled Arnold and sent him crashing through a glass table, creating a crater in the ground. Don Pink made the next Bronze Assessment
            happen quicker so the Task Force could become proctors. The Task Force learned of the true power of the Don's, which they most likely got from their Holy Brands, 
            tatoo-like marks caused by forming pacts with gods. While on Patrol, the Task Force met a girl who was being robbed. It turns out the girl is Cheeta,
            Cheeto's little sister. Originally she wanted to kill Aphelios for putting her brother in jail, but she realized jail might be the best
            thing to help rehabilitate Cheeto. Cheeta then fell in love with Aphelios and became the leader of the Aphelios Ross Fan Club. Aphelios, Arnold, and Letalia 
            all got calls from companies who wanted to sponsor them. The Task Force then proctored the next Bronze Assessment, where the Ab Family all passed. 
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Silver Trial</h2>
            
            The Task Force got a call from the Society of Evil, informing them that the leader of the society had requested them. The leader of the Society of Evil,
            Flat Top, is a young man who desperately wants to change the society for the better. Flat Top believes being evil is outdated and uncool, and he
            wants to make the Society of Evil good. The Society of Evil has a bad reputation because of the actions of the previous leaders, and Flat Top thinks the Task
            Force can help with that thanks to their new found popularity. The Task Force takes on the Silver Trial! The first test is a Psychological
            Evaluation where The Task Force are asked questions about their goals and their beliefs. The second test is an Interrogation Test, where the Task
            Force figure out that a young man named Xavier was killed by his cousin Wyatt. Their other cousin, Zeke, helped hide the body. Kenny breaks Wyatt's
            leg and Aphelios doesn't like that. Kenny and Aphelios then engage in a fight! Despite originally trying to stay uninvolved, Letalia and Arnold helped
            Aphelios in his fight, earning the respect of Kenny, allowing them to pass the secret last part of the Exam, the Friendship Test. The Task Force are now
            Silver Star Knights! JB explains his history as a Knight of Justice who lost his rank because he was trying to expose the Dons.

           <h1>Silver Star Saga</h1>

           <h2>Father's Day Fun</h2>

           The Task Force met up at Alain's Bar for drinks to celebrate their passing of the Silver Trial. Alain allowed the Task Force to enter the VIP section of
           the bar since all of the members have at least a Silver Star. There the Task  Force encountered Violet Bones! She's now working as a singer at the bar.
           Violet managed to avoid jail time by pinning all of her responsibility in the Mother's Day Maniac murders on her brother; claiming that he manipulated her
           into helping him kill college students. Arnold managed to get Violet's number, though. Cliff, Cyrus, and Ned all entered the VIP section and hung out with
           their kids on the Task Force. Each dad taught their kid a new technique. Letalia learned Incinerate, Arnold learned Muscle Expansion, and Aphelios learned 
           Super Salute. Overall it's a fun Father's Day. Don Pink scheduled a meeting with the King, and the Task Force went to meet him. The Task Force was stopped
           by Gobo, who revealed that he is a Gold Star Knight. Gobo didn't want the Task Force bothering the King. Aphelios managed to get Gobo to agree to a staring
           contest with Letalia, and Gobo lost. Gobo tried leaving, but Arnold gave him a wedgie, so Gobo beat Arnold up. The Task Force met the King, who
           nearly executed the team, but Aphelios managed to get the King to agree to investigate the Dons. The King asked Aphelios and the Task Force to befriend his 
           son Gobo.

           <h2>Investigation of Don Blue </h2>

           JB got some intel from the King that Don Blue may be up to no good. JB asked the Task Force to interrogate Mikey, because Mikey lived in an aprtment that's
           secretly owned by Don Blue. Mikey was willing to give information on Don Blue, but first he wanted his jail time reduced. Aphelios managed to work out a 
           deal with Mikey: house arrest for the remainder of Mikey's sentence in exchange for information on Don Blue. Mikey revelead that Don Blue has been cutting all 
           sorts of corners on Mikey's apartment building and that Don Blue has turned a blind eye to all sorts of illegal activity. Don Pink agrees to help the Task Force 
           apprehend Don Blue. Don Pink shows the Task Force her Holy Brand power, Lovely Guardian, which should help protect the Task Force members in the event that a 
           fight with Don Blue occurs.
