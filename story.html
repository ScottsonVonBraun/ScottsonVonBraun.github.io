            <h1>Starless Saga</h1>
            <h2>Le Elegante Overdose</h2>

            The King’s Secret Knight Task Force begins its first mission! Le Elegante, Letalia’s alma mater,  
            was once one of the most prestigious schools in all of Newtopia City. However, tragedy struck the 
            esteemed academy due to the death of one of its new students. The student’s death was determined 
            to be an overdose, and after interrogating students and teachers at the school, it was discovered 
            that the man who supplied the drugs was a small-time dealer, named Mida Bendo. The Task Force takes 
            some time to rest. Julian and Letalia hang out at a burger shop, and Aphelios befriends Chaddeus at 
            the gym. The Task Force confronts Mida while he’s working at the movie theater, and while Mida was 
            originally aggressive, he eventually gave himself up to protect his family. Mida handed over intel on 
            the whereabouts of his team’s drug warehouse, leading to the capture of Lucy, one of the team’s members. 
            Lucy’s interrogation went wrong, leading to Julian, killing her. Julian then went nuts and shot JB!
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Trial of Julian Hotapepperin</h2>

            Julian was captured and sentenced to trial for his assault on JB, the murder of Lucy, among other crimes 
            he’s committed. The ones preceding over the trial were three members of the Knights of Justice, the 12 
            strongest knights on the force. Stuart the Rat was the prosecutor. Medusa the Snake was the bailiff. 
            Oxford the Ox was the judge. Despite overwhelming evidence, Julian fought for his case til the bitter end, 
            losing all respect from those in the courtroom. After a botched attempt to escape, Oxford sliced Julian 
            in half with his Greataxe, killing him instantly. 
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Disappearance of Wendy Blue</h2>

            After Arnold joins the Task Force, the team begins their second mission. Don Blue, one of the five Dons 
            who control most of Newtopia City, has reported the disappearance of his daughter, the local corner store 
            clerk. Her trail leads to a rundown apartment owned by her ex-boyfriend, Mikey. After interrogating Mikey, 
            the team learns they had a falling out, and she ran off to the Casino to make some quick cash to leave the 
            city. A series of unfortunate events led to Mikey’s subsequent arrest. The Casino is run by Don Red, who 
            allows the team back to the VIP section where Wendy is being held, after a game of Russian Roulette. Wendy 
            is being used as a sacrifice by Countess Baroba, for her ritual to the god, Frigalhei. The Task Force is able 
            to save Wendy and subdue Baroba, but right as they are about to leave, Baroba is taken back by Don Red. 
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Bronze Assessment</h2>

            In order to obtain power and respect in the Knight Force, one must improve his Star Ranking. Currently, the 
            Task Force are all Starless, but by completing the Bronze Assessment, they can rank up to obtain their Bronze 
            Stars. After taking a day off on a trip to the movies, the following day, the team takes the Bronze Assessment. 
            The team goes through three trials: a Knowledge Test, a Fitness Test, and a Combat Test. Along the way they 
            meet a strange group known as the Ab Family, who annoy and disrupt them at every turn during the exam. However, 
            by defeating them in the Combat Test, they manage to pass the Bronze Assessment, becoming Bronze Star Knights!

            <h1>Bronze Star Saga</h1>

            <h2>Wet Willy Killer</h2>

            For the first mission as Bronze Star Knights, the Task Force investigates the mysterious Wet Willy Killer, a 
            serial killer known by his calling card, giving all of his victims wet willies. Letalia finds out from one of the 
            teachers of the victims that they were all in the same class along with a strange Loxa kid. The team stake’s out 
            the house of Nadine, the last remaining girl who was a member of the victim’s friend group. After some strange 
            encounters with some of the neighbors, Nadine returns after going on a date with the Loxa, named Cheeto. Cheeto 
            is revealed to be the killer! Aphelios tries to reason with him, as they’re both Loxo people, but unfortunately, 
            Cheeto is too deranged. While the team manages to subdue Cheeto, he kills Nadine by slitting her throat. The Task 
            Force is left feeling defeated, but JB reminds them that they must shine on, even in the darkest of nights!
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Don Blue’s Party</h2>

            The Task Force is visited by Stuart the Rat and Medusa the Snake, two of the Knights of Justice from Julian’s trial. 
            Medusa distracts Arnold, and Stuart forces everyone else to stick to the story that Julian was actually a hero to protect 
            the reputation of the Knight Force. Later, the Task Force is given a strange request by Don Blue to act as bouncers for a 
            party he’s throwing for his daughter Wendy. The Task Force does well as bouncers, but at the end of their night, they’re 
            approached by Countess Baroba and Don Red! While Arnold tries to stand his ground, he senses the insane power of Don Red 
            and is scared into running away. 
            <p></p><hr>

            <h2>Mother’s Day Maniac</h2>

            After infiltrating the Society of Evil, the Task Force’s meeting is interrupted by Kenny the Knight who informs them that a 
            distress call came from a cabin in the woods, known as The Cabin. The team visits The Cabin and finds the body of a girl who’s 
            been beaten to death. Arnold and Letalia try to find the source of a scream they hear and come face to face with a Large Man 
            who has one of the vacationing college students, Billy, cornered. Arnold and Letalia are no match for the Large Man’s power, 
            so they are all forced to flee on Letalia’s back after she transforms into a horse. Meanwhile, Aphelios stays back to keep 
            watch over the other students: Logan, Martin, and Violet. Martin tries to convince the team to cut their losses and escape, 
            as he believes the Large Man to be the Mother’s Day Maniac, a killer who murdered a bunch of teenagers a few years ago. However, 
            Martin ends up in an argument with Logan who doesn’t want to leave his friends behind, leading to a fight where Martin ends up 
            falling down the stairs and breaking his neck, killing him. The Mother’s Day Maniac makes it to the cabin as well as a crying Violet, 
            who is carrying the dead body of her dear friend, Shauna, Billy’s girlfriend. With everyone's combined effort, they are able to defeat 
            the Mother’s Day Maniac, who is revealed to be VIolet’s brother, Barry Bones! Violet and Barry were working together in this killer 
            operation, so both are arrested. Logan is also arrested for the accidental murder of Martin, and Billy decides to beome a Knight under 
            Arnold’s tutelage.
